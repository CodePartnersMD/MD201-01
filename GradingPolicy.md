### Makeup Policy

We are willing to work with students who are falling behind but we require you to proceed with the following steps:

1. reach out to us on slack and inform us of what you are struggling with
2. come in during open office hours from 1 hour before or 30 minutes following class for additional instruction
3. show us you are committed by completing the reading assignments and journals so we can identify your learning progress. 

We cannot be held accountable for students who do not follow these steps.  We want to see you succeed but the learning process is a two way street.
