### Makeup Policy

We are willing to work with students who are falling behind but we require you to proceed with the following steps:

1. reach out to us on slack and inform us of what you are struggling with
2. Ensure you have regular commit history so we can observe your progress
3. come in during open office hours from 1 hour before class for additional instruction
3. show us you are committed by completing the reading assignments and journals so we can identify your learning progress. 

We cannot be held accountable for students who do not follow these steps.  We want to see you succeed but you are responsible for your own learning.
