    <h3> Here are the top 10 things I'm enjoying about CodePartners</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> The structure of the class - really helpful to come in the evenings, and meeting (nearly) every day is realy helpful. We usually end on a preview of the next day's material, which is great.  I love how Zach and Davis (see below) are reinforcing the content we learn and giving us 1-on-1 assistance.</li>
        <li> The content - we've only taken baby steps but they are 'giant' baby steps for someone with no experience like me </li>
        <li> The people taking the class: yes, here's looking at you Karrim, Patrice, Jayne, Joseph, Brittany, Adrian, George, Jahlal, Mandana, Dan and Ishmael </li>
        <li> The instructors: Zach is pretty awesome, dude has worked for a bunch of startups and is really trying to prep us for whatever path we want to take </li>
        <li> The instructors (cont.): Davis is a genius, really cool guy (true story: i asked about the difference between caffeine and sugar and he began explaining how the body breaks down ATP for energy and it's relation to sleep like it was nothing)</li>
        <li> The location: Bethesda is pretty convenient </li>
        <li> DAI: I had never heard of DAI, the place does some amazing work and everyone i've met so far is cool</li>
        <li> John: Cannot forget the Code 102 instructor, guy really helped prepare us for Code 201, very nice guy </li>
        <li> MEI!!!! Mei is awesome, and really trying to help us out </li>
        <li> Doug!! Doug is the CEO of CodePartners and is rolling out the stops for all of us in the inaugural cohort, he's really making us feel like we are going to succeed </li>
        <li> David Nguyen: I've never met this guy, but he's the co-founder of CodePartners, so i got to shout him out here, THANK YOU (ps. and he's into the blockchain, which is awesome)</li>
        <li></li> BONUS : The coffee machine in the break area
