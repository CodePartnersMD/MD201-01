# Assignment Overview: Lab 13

Marketing has gotten a lot of negative feedback from users who want to store their results, so that when they refresh the page, *or even if they leave their browser and return later* they can still see their data from before.

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Do today's work on a branch called `local-storage`.

- Give your BusMall app some persistence by using local storage to store your voting data! The goal is to have all of your click data persist through a page refresh or through completely closing the browser.

The Target date for this milestone is 5:59pm 7/23/18.  Your instructors will be expecting the technical requirements to be met by that date, with regular and descriptive commit messages and merged into master/dev branch.
