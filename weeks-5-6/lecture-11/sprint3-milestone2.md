 # Sprint 3 Milestone 2

Your savvy marketing person has just informed you that just showing users the numbered data of the click percentages is not going to cut it.
You need a visual representation to grab the user's attention.

### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Do today's work on a branch called `chartjs`.

- Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart as instructed in the initial definition of the BusMall assignment. If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images. Hint: for this type of data, bar charts work well.

The Target date for this milestone is 8:59am 7/21/18.  Your instructors will be expecting the technical requirements to be met by that date, with regular and descriptive commit messages and merged into master/dev branch.
