    <p class="malaria-story">14 November 2016, Jalalabad, Nangarhar – On a scorching July afternoon several years ago, a farmer rushed into a laboratory in downtown Jalalabad with his two-year-old son, Sabawoon, fainting in his arms. “I’m here to test him for malaria!” he blurted out.</p>
    <p class="malaria-story"><em>Sabawoon</em> had already been sick for <strong>two months</strong>two months in his rural village, but no one knew what was wrong. Even though Afghanistan has the fourth-largest malaria burden outside of sub-Saharan Africa, diagnostic facilities were extremely limited. This laboratory in Jalalabad was the only place in the whole province with a track record of diagnosing the most severe form of malaria. Just one sharp-eyed technician and his ageing microscope meant the difference between diagnosis and disaster.</p>

    <p id="malaria-stat">These days, things are different. Thanks to new testing kits provided by UNDP and the Global Fund to 14,500 clinics across Afghanistan, village health workers can now prick a villager’s finger and get an accurate blood test in just 30 minutes. In a country with only one physician for every 3,750 people, these kits save lives because they can be used even by local health workers with minimal training.</p>
